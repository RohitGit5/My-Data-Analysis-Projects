**HR Attrition Insights :** Analyzing Factors Contributing to Employee Attrition
**Goal:** To determine the factors contributing the most to employee attrition within a company.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of employee records from a company, including details such as job roles, salaries, years at the company, age, job satisfaction, and attrition rates. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identifying key factors correlated with employee attrition rates.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data visualization

**Technology:** Power BI, CSV

**Results:** Key insights from the analysis highlighted that attrition was notably high among employees receiving moderate salary hikes, lower salary levels, younger age groups, and specific job roles such as Laboratory Technicians, who also reported poor job satisfaction. Furthermore, employees with fewer years at the company exhibited higher attrition rates. These findings can help inform HR strategies to mitigate attrition by targeting salary and job satisfaction issues.
